# NOT A KEYLOGGER

### What does it do?

Essentially, the application records previous keyboard and mouse inputs ~~and plays them back.~~

### Who uses it?

Sometimes, you just want to automate a repetitive task on your computer that requires you to
repeatedly click on the screen, like for example some UBC courses involve a certain program that
starts with an i and ends in an r ;)

### Why am I interested?

There are some repetitive tasks that occur in not-well-designed programs that do not have keyboard shortcuts
that I would like to automate.

For instance:

- In vanilla minecraft, repetitive clicking is required to empty your inventory into a chest, which makes
  it quite painful to empty an inventory. There aren't any keyboard shortcuts for this as well. While mods
  do fix this issue, not all Minecraft servers support mods.
- That app that starts with an i and ends in r.
